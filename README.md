# 🚀 Hirable AI
**Your personal AI interviewer for tech jobs.**

---

## 🧩 Problem
Most candidates prepare by memorizing answers —  
but **no one evaluates how good THEIR answer actually is.**

Mock interviews are:
- Hard to find
- Time-consuming
- Not personalized
- Lacking structured feedback

As a result, candidates enter real interviews **blind about their readiness.**

---

## ✅ Solution
**Hirable AI** simulates a real technical interviewer that:
- Asks real CS/tech interview questions
- Lets you answer via text or voice
- Scores your response (1–10)
- Gives critique & improvement tips
- Shows an ideal model answer
- Tracks weak topics over time

It’s like having a **24/7 interview coach.**
