🚀 Hirable AI

Your personal AI interviewer for tech jobs.

🧩 Problem

Most students prepare for interviews by reading answers—
but no one tells them how good THEIR answer actually is.

Mock interviews are:

Hard to find

Time consuming

Not personalized

Lacking structured feedback

So candidates walk into real interviews blind about their true readiness.

✅ Solution

Hirable AI simulates a real technical interviewer that:

Asks real CS/tech interview questions

Lets you answer via text or voice

Scores your response

Gives critique and a model answer

Tracks your weak topics over time

It’s like having a 24/7 interview coach.
